These high number of IS are linked to the loss of the ability to use many nutrients for metabolic process.\nIS may affect metabolism by directly disrupting nearby genes or indirectly through genome rearrangements over time. Despite these loses, the sub lineages still keep a core of metabolic traits that likely help the survive.\n\n\nA metagenomics pipeline reveals insertion sequence-driven evolution of the microbiota\n\n\nDeveloped new IS database ISOSDB, expanding IS diversity of ISfinder, it is built from single and metagenome data.\nBuilt the pseudoR to wok with the new database, can use metagenomic data for the input.\nIS in gut bacteria is diverse regardless of the lifestyle and geopgraphy. These inertions usually target accessory genes (not cor genes for survival?)\niORF evenets is usually unique to individual microbiome\nIS insertions are temporary stable and maintained, and others only detected at specific timepoint. Microbiota actively forming new insertions.\nAntibiotic pressure cause significant loss of IS diversity, and usually unrecovered afftar the expossure.\nDiet intervensions affect the IS insertions, in respond to metabolic process adaptation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarted reading the following papers:\n\nMobile Genetic Elements Associated with Antimicrobial Resistance\n\n\nReview specieally highlights ESKAPEE pathogens (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, S. aureus) in the resistance dissemination.\nMGE including IS, transposon, integron, gene cassette, plasmid are driver horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes among pathogenes. They play significant role in the acquisition, accumulation, and dissemination of antimicrobial resistence (AMR) genes.\nClassification of IS by:\n\nAmino acids transpoase motifs, DDE (Asp-Asp-Glu) is the most common.\nTransposition mechanisms, cut or copy paste\n\nTerminal inverted repeats typically found at both end of IS\nISfinder is manually curated database for IS elements.\nNaming shceme: it comnbines species origin and an ID number (e.g., ISAba1 from Acinetobacter baumannii).\nIS can activate resistance genes by inserting upstream, distruping genes nearby, or facilitating cimposite transposon\nIS can flank resistence gene(s) to form composite transposon\nIS integrate into plasmid, driving HGT\nMultiple identical MGE collapse during WGS assembly, resistance islands become fragmented across contigs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy access request to Bunya HPC has been approved.\nLogged into HPC, set up keygen ssh\nStarted reading the following papers:\n\nEveryman’s Guide to Bacterial Insertion Sequences\n\n\nIS play big roles in the genomic evolutions, including gene rearrangement, gene modulation, and HGT.\nTHey have high diversity &gt; 4000 identified IS, it will increase along with sequencing project, and make it the boundaries with other MGE less clear\nFamily definitions are qualitative/descriptive.\nIS is defined a short (0.7 and 2.5 kb) DNA elements encoding only enzymes requires for its mobility. Their genetic compotition are compact with mosly two open reading frames (orfs) which occupy the entire length of the IS and terminate in flanking imperfect terminal repeat sequences (IR).\nISfinder is curated IS database as well as it provides a framework for nomenclature and IS classification into related groups or families.\nMajor IS groups is characterised by the chemestry they use to breaking and rejoining: motif DDE (and DEDD) and HUH enzymes.\nDDE transposases IS are distinguished by the second (“nontransferred”) strand is processed:\n\nCoointegrate (copy and paste): IS6\nCut and paste in, with 2 bp footprint in donor site: IS630\nCut and paste in, with haipin formation: IS4\nReplicate circle formed, with donor retained (copy and paste): IS3, IS2, IS911\n\nIS is ismple TE with only transpoase, composite transposon is two IS elements flanking genes, unit tranposon is ingle unit Tpase with cargo, ICE is integrated + conjugative transfer\nTransporter IS carry passager genes that are not related to mobility, antibiotic resistance genes (ISCgl1, IS481 family)\nIS91/ISCR group is associated with diverse antibiotic resistance genes\nIS can rapidly invrease copy number (expansion), remove unnecessary genes (in nuitrient rich environtment).\nIS can modulate gene expression (resistance gene) in two main ways:\n\ninsert in coding sequence and distrupt the expression\nbring the promoter, induce gene activation.\n\nIS insertion is not entirely random:\n\nSome IS prefer specific motifs, IS630 prefer TA in the target\nSome IS prefer AT-rich or GC-rich regions\n\nISfinder groups IS into families based on structural and functional characteristics (Transpoase motifs, IR, TSD, orf, target preference, etc)\n29 IS families identified in ISfinder\nIS doesn’t include every IS that exists, the sequence come from reseachers who studied and submited it. New database expansion or exploration will likely lead to new families or groups.\nIS1 (DDE transpoase) plays a role in spreading antibiotic resistence by flanking that genes on transposon or plasmid.\nIS3 (DDE transpoase) is the biggest IS family with &gt;550 members found in &gt; 270 species\n\n\nISfinder: the reference centre for bacterial insertion sequences\n\n\nISfinder defines ISD as short genetically compact DNA segments (between 0.7 and 2.5 kb) encoding no functions other than those involved in their mobility.\nISfinder is manual curation (need to fill out the submission form) exclusively for IS database. It also play role as Inaming convention/nomenclature).\nFollow naming system from restriction enzyme. example: ISKpn1 (found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, and unique identifier 1). Drawback: some IS elements are found in multiple taxa. Hystorical number blocks are preserved in the database.\nISfinder utilises MySQL structure\nIt provides: DNA sequence, orf/poteintal coding sequence, TIR and TSD, Taxonomic origin, IS family, reference, NCBI taxonomy, also tools like BLAST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted the Health Safety and Wellness Induction training on Blackboard\nComplerted the Annual Fire Safety training on Blackboard\nStarted reading the following papers:\n\nQuantitative assessment of insertion sequence impact on bacterial genome architecture\n\n\nThey introduced ISseeker to anotate IS element in the draft genome assembly\nUsing genome assembly draft as an input, less computational cost.\nIt identifies IS by blasting their flanking sequences (500 bp) to a reference genome. Both full long contigs includes IS and flanks and and truncated IS (but flanks remain)\nThese flank can tell us where the IS location in the host genome.\nIf match is found, IS is annotated as mapped. The location relative to adjacent genes in the reference genome (user specified) is reported.\nIt doesn’t use ISfinder\nIt does not give us the full inserted sequence, it doesn’t classifiy IS, it doesn’t give functional effect\nPhylogenetically they suggested that many IS insertion in A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae are conserved.\nIS elements can insert intragenically (within genes) or intergenically (between genes)\nMultiple IS insertion in same region (A. baumannii)\nAlthough the genome size is about 30 % smaller than K. pneumoniae genomes (~5.6 Mbp), IS element density from A. baumannii is greater.\n\n\nImpact of insertion sequences on convergent evolution of Shigella species\n\n\nIS in Shigella genomes account 5-8% of bases, much higher than E.coli with &lt;1%.\nThey used ISMapper to identify insertion sites in chromosomes.\nWithin each Shigella species (S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. sonnei), there are variation in both the number and the location of IS insertion. These IS insertion patterns could be use to differentiate phylogenetic lineages.\nIS transposition has been ongoing since each species split\nS. sonnei, S. dysenteriae, and S. flexneri share 53%, 82%, ~33% sites between lineages, respectively. IS Insertion can reflect recent and previous evolution history.\nFive common IS (IS1, IS2, IS4, IS600, IS911) made upp most insertion in Shigella reference genomes, with IS1 contributed the most. These insertion contributing in convergent evolution of the genus.\nThey measured recent IS activity by counted strain specific insertions divided by strain specific SNVs. S. sonnei shows significantly higher recent activity for all five IS\nProportion of pseudogenes associated with IS insertion is 50% in S. sonnei, 22% in S. flexneri and 35% in S. dysenteriae. Significant number of convserved pseudogenes were interupted by IS.\nInsertions events are less frequent in gene regions (0.20 in S. flexneri, 0.29 in S. sonnei, 0.11 in S. dysenteriae), suggesting purifying selection against insertion in CDS.\nIS contributed to pathways loss in each species. Disrupting individual metabolic gene or multiple hits within the same pathway. All ancient pathway inactivation events (&gt;80% of genomes) within metabolic reactions were IS insertions in S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae, and 30% in S. flexneri.\nISmapper detects IS by mapping paired reads to a list of query IS sequences. Then it finds pairs that only one mapped to the query (unmapped mates correspond to the flanking genomic DNA). These “flanking” reads then map to the reference genome to get insertion location.\n\n\nTransposases are the most abundant, most ubiquitous genes in nature\n\n\nUsing genomes and metagenomes data, they found that transposase gene that produce eznyme that enable movement within part of genome outnumber any other type of genes, including housekeeping genes.\nPreviously labelled as selfish genes with no other purpose than propagating themse;f, the finding that transpoase more abundance that all essential genes, support the idea that these DNA elements play role in host adaptation.\nThis group of mobile element leads to mutation and genome rearrangements that affect diversiciation and adaptation, and drive evolution.\n\n\nIS26 and the IS26 family: versatile resistance gene movers and genome reorganizers\n\n\nIS26 is found in plasmid and chromosome of pathogens like E. coli and Klebsiella.\nIt is known for good at spreading resistance gene\nIS26 is 820 bp long with perfectly matching 14 bp TIR. S26 includes a single open reading frame, tnp26, that encodes the 234-aa DDE transposase designated Tnp26, and Tnp26 is required for movement. Movement of IS26 to a new location generates a TSD of 8 bp.\nIts promoters within the TIRs allow not only expression of its own gene but can also enhance antibiotic resistance gene expression nearby.\nIS26 forms cointegrates rather than simply inserting a copy itself. The incoming replicon carrying IS26 becomes flanked by two IS26 copies.\n\nIS26 has unquie moving mechanism, that enables them spreading resistence genes. It has two distinct cointegration, Pseudo composite transposon (PCT) formation.\n\nIS26 enables A. baumannii to capture and integrate resistance genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared ISFinder vs ISOSDB\n\nISFinder is a manually curated IS database, the submission requires the researchers to fill out the form. It also provide naming convention for IS.\nISOSDB include much larger collection of IS sequences than ISFinder (extended version). They author identified IS element using OASIS from publicly available metagenome and genome. OASIS takes genbank format file (.gbk) as an input and alrady transposases annotated. It has different naming convention with ISFinder (ISOSDB prefix) The IS elements are included in the ISOSDB if meet following criteria:\n\nat least two copies of the IS element in a single genome,\nflanked by terminal IRs\nit has significant nucleotide homology to an IS element in ISFinder or has a putative transposase.\n\n\nCompared the existing tools\n\nOASIS\n\nOASIS using annotated transposase from genebank file. It then groups IS into multicopy ISs and single-copy ISs. The edges (or flanking?) of Multicopy ISs defined with homology (maximum likelihood). Edges of single and multicopy (re)define by IR. Identifies partial and missing IS using blast. Then group IS sequeces using hierechial clustering.\nClassifiy the detected IS sequence using ISfinder database.\nIt doesn’t require the user to provide a reference genome or to provide query IS sequence. The input only gbk file. It relies on the gene (of Tpases) annotation form the genebank file.\n\nIS_mapper\n\nISMapper takes as input: a set of paired end Illumina reads, an IS query sequence in fasta format, a referenc genome sequence, in GenBank or FASTA format.\nThe paired end read then are mapped to the IS query, looking for unmapped mate reads, that is reads representing the sequences directly flanking the IS (is it always the case?). The left and right flanking sequences is then mapped to the referenc egenome to find the location of the query IS. Left and right end blocks are extracted, close indiciating (known IS position relative tto the reference), overlaped (novel IS position).\n\nISSeeker\n\nISSeeker takes assembly draft/collection of contigs as an input. The program aligns (using BLAST) collection of IS elemets to the collection of cotigs (assembly draft), looking for full or partial (edges) matches, then it extraxts both flanking regions of that matches (500bp). These flanking (of insetion) region then mapped again to the reference to get the relative position in the genome, infering where the insertion events happened.\nIt attempts to pair left and right flanks that mapped in the same location in the referecne genome to infer a single insertion event.\n\nISEScan\n\nThe program only use a (draft) genome or metagenome sequence (fasta) as an input. It scan and translate to protein sequence for each enry from the file to identify the transpoase sequences.\nIt uses profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs), that is built from Transposase sequence by evolutionary relationshiop, to search remote homolog of transposase sequences from the given fasta.\nSimiliar o OASIS, it groups the IS candidate into single copy and multicopy to identify the edges (boundaries). Then reomve redundants result with hierarchical clustering. Boundaries of a single copy IS is defined by IR, multi copy ISs is determined by homology of those sequences and shared IRs.\nAfter idnetifyng transposase ORF, the porgram defines the flanking regions (regions around ORF). It then predicts IRs using local alignment (SW) algorithm to compare left side regions DNA sequences againts the reverse complement of the right side regions. It searches both nearby and farther regions.\n\npseudoR\n\nIS detection pipeline that uses ISOSDB\nIt doesn’t rely on paired-end information, instead it uses split reqd approach (looking reads that partially mapped to the assembled genome?).\nSequencing reads are first mapped to the assembled contigs. The program then collects all read that are unmapped. These reads the are aligned again to a ISOSDB search for IS terminal ends. If a read contains an IS terminus, that part is deleted, and the rest of the sequence is remapped to the assembled contigs.\n\ndigIS\n\nThe program searches for the most conserved part of Tpase (DDE motifs), the catalytic domain.\nIt takes genome (complete?) in fasta as an input, optionally with annotation file gbk. It then translates whole DNA sequence from the input file into protein sequence. Catalyc domain the input sequence is detected using manually curated pHMMs, and the matche regions are tagged as seeds. The seeds are theen extended to get the transaposase sequence of predicted IS.\npHMMs are built from MSAa of transposase catalyc domain for each IS family using sequences from ISFinder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLineage: A broad group of bacteria that shares a common evolutionary ancestor.\nSublineage: A small group within a lineage that diverge further, because accumulation of mutation, IS insertions, and other genome rearrangements.\nInverted repeats (IRs): short DNA sequences at both end of a IS, where the sequence on one end is the reverse complement of the other end (boundaries of the IS). Inverted and complementary.\nDirect Target Repeats (DTRs): Created during integration, identical sequences (footprint of insertion)\niORF: Insertion event of IS in the ORF (genes) that may knock off or regulate the gene expression.\nComposite Transposon: Two IS in the flanking segement with (resistence) gene in the middle.\nTarget Site Duplications (TSD): short flanking direct repeats (DR, typically ∼3 to 14 bp\nGene cassette: Small (0.5-1kb), carry a single gene, often lack a promoter. It can exist as free circular cassette, but only functional when it is inserted into an integron.\nIntegron: It has intl (a site specific recombinase), recombination site, and a promoter for cassete gene expression. They are not mobile by themselves, but embeded in transposons.\nUnit transposons (Tn): Larger than IS, carry additional genes, such as antibiotic resistance genes.\nPlasmids: Self replicating extrachromosomal DNA. They often carry multiple MGE including IS, transposon\nSerotype: groups bacteria/viruses using antigen or toher molecule on the their surfaces\nConvergent evolution: evolution process that is driven by environment adaptation from distantly related species.\nPseudogene: Region that resemble gene structure but inactive due to mutation/IS insertion\nPseudo-Compound Transposons: DNA sequence that is flanked by two IS26s in the same direction, carrying antibiotic resistance genes.\nPutative transposase: Predicted to be transposase (using sequence similarity, motifs, etc), but it’s not experimentally confirmed.\nFlanking sequence: DNA sequences that adjacent to the IS element, on the left and right ends."

All ancient pathway inactivation events (&gt;80% of genomes) within metabolic reactions were IS insertions in S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae, and 30% in S. flexneri.\nISmapper detects IS by mapping paired reads to a list of query IS sequences. Then it finds pairs that only one mapped to the query (unmapped mates correspond to the flanking genomic DNA). These “flanking” reads then map to the reference genome to get insertion location.\n\n\nTransposases are the most abundant, most ubiquitous genes in nature\n\n\nUsing genomes and metagenomes data, they found that transposase gene that produce eznyme that enable movement within part of genome outnumber any other type of genes, including housekeeping genes.\nPreviously labelled as selfish genes with no other purpose than propagating themse;f, the finding that transpoase more abundance that all essential genes, support the idea that these DNA elements play role in host adaptation.\nThis group of mobile element leads to mutation and genome rearrangements that affect diversiciation and adaptation, and drive evolution.\n\n\nIS26 and the IS26 family: versatile resistance gene movers and genome reorganizers\n\n\nIS26 is found in plasmid and chromosome of pathogens like E. coli and Klebsiella.\nIt is known for good at spreading resistance gene\nIS26 is 820 bp long with perfectly matching 14 bp TIR. S26 includes a single open reading frame, tnp26, that encodes the 234-aa DDE transposase designated Tnp26, and Tnp26 is required for movement. Movement of IS26 to a new location generates a TSD of 8 bp.\nIts promoters within the TIRs allow not only expression of its own gene but can also enhance antibiotic resistance gene expression nearby.\nIS26 forms cointegrates rather than simply inserting a copy itself. The incoming replicon carrying IS26 becomes flanked by two IS26 copies.\n\nIS26 has unquie moving mechanism, that enables them spreading resistence genes. It has two distinct cointegration, Pseudo composite transposon (PCT) formation.\n\nIS26 enables A. baumannii to capture and integrate resistance genes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared ISFinder vs ISOSDB\n\nISFinder is a manually curated IS database, the submission requires the researchers to fill out the form. It also provide naming convention for IS.\nISOSDB include much larger collection of IS sequences than ISFinder (extended version). They author identified IS element using OASIS from publicly available metagenome and genome. OASIS takes genbank format file (.gbk) as an input and alrady transposases annotated. It has different naming convention with ISFinder (ISOSDB prefix) The IS elements are included in the ISOSDB if meet following criteria:\n\nat least two copies of the IS element in a single genome,\nflanked by terminal IRs\nit has significant nucleotide homology to an IS element in ISFinder or has a putative transposase.\n\n\nCompared the existing tools\n\nOASIS\n\nOASIS using annotated transposase from genebank file. It then groups IS into multicopy ISs and single-copy ISs. The edges (or flanking?) of Multicopy ISs defined with homology (maximum likelihood). Edges of single and multicopy (re)define by IR. Identifies partial and missing IS using blast. Then group IS sequeces using hierechial clustering.\nClassifiy the detected IS sequence using ISfinder database.\nIt doesn’t require the user to provide a reference genome or to provide query IS sequence. The input only gbk file. It relies on the gene (of Tpases) annotation form the genebank file.\n\nIS_mapper\n\nISMapper takes as input: a set of paired end Illumina reads, an IS query sequence in fasta format, a referenc genome sequence, in GenBank or FASTA format.\nThe paired end read then are mapped to the IS query, looking for unmapped mate reads, that is reads representing the sequences directly flanking the IS (is it always the case?). The left and right flanking sequences is then mapped to the referenc egenome to find the location of the query IS. Left and right end blocks are extracted, close indiciating (known IS position relative tto the reference), overlaped (novel IS position).\n\nISSeeker\n\nISSeeker takes assembly draft/collection of contigs as an input. The program aligns (using BLAST) collection of IS elemets to the collection of cotigs (assembly draft), looking for full or partial (edges) matches, then it extraxts both flanking regions of that matches (500bp). These flanking (of insetion) region then mapped again to the reference to get the relative position in the genome, infering where the insertion events happened.\nIt attempts to pair left and right flanks that mapped in the same location in the referecne genome to infer a single insertion event.\n\nISEScan\n\nThe program only use a (draft) genome or metagenome sequence (fasta) as an input. It scan and translate to protein sequence for each enry from the file to identify the transpoase sequences.\nIt uses profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs), that is built from Transposase sequence by evolutionary relationshiop, to search remote homolog of transposase sequences from the given fasta.\nSimiliar o OASIS, it groups the IS candidate into single copy and multicopy to identify the edges (boundaries). Then reomve redundants result with hierarchical clustering. Boundaries of a single copy IS is defined by IR, multi copy ISs is determined by homology of those sequences and shared IRs.\nAfter idnetifyng transposase ORF, the porgram defines the flanking regions (regions around ORF). It then predicts IRs using local alignment (SW) algorithm to compare left side regions DNA sequences againts the reverse complement of the right side regions. It searches both nearby and farther regions.\n\npseudoR\n\nIS detection pipeline that uses ISOSDB\nIt doesn’t rely on paired-end information, instead it uses split reqd approach (looking reads that partially mapped to the assembled genome?).\nSequencing reads are first mapped to the assembled contigs. The program then collects all read that are unmapped. These reads the are aligned again to a ISOSDB search for IS terminal ends. If a read contains an IS terminus, that part is deleted, and the rest of the sequence is remapped to the assembled contigs.\n\ndigIS\n\nThe program searches for the most conserved part of Tpase (DDE motifs), the catalytic domain.\nIt takes genome (complete?) in fasta as an input, optionally with annotation file gbk. It then translates whole DNA sequence from the input file into protein sequence. Catalyc domain the input sequence is detected using manually curated pHMMs, and the matche regions are tagged as seeds. The seeds are theen extended to get the transaposase sequence of predicted IS.\npHMMs are built from MSAa of transposase catalyc domain for each IS family using sequences from ISFinder."
