# Overview

## Daily Log

### 08-09-2025

-   Weekly project meeting

-   All the IS that eris missed are truncated sequences. I will extract the sequences from the chromosome and play around with minimap2 settings in eris to understand why they were missed.

-   For fragmented IS spread across multiple contigs, I wrote a module using a graph traversal approach to collapse them and quantify their copy numbers. It works quite well on some identified IS and can correct both undercounted and overcounted IS from contigs.

-   `FragGeneScan` has better sensitivity, but lower precision compared to `pyrodigal` on EC958. It is because `FragGeneScan` can predict on the truncated ORF sequence?

-   Use [F1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) score to include the balance of senisitivity and precision.

-   Dimas will read through [Michael's paper](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.98300.3) and download the dataset
